# Magma v2.1
### A whole new experience, built from the ground up.

Hello random person! I want to share with you one of my most ambitious projects: Magma Injector & Executor (or just Magma for short). Magma [*was*](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/welcoming-byfron-to-roblox/2018233) a Level 7+ Roblox Lua Executor as well as an Internal DLL Injector built entirely in Microsoft's WPF .NET Framework. 
I made Magma because i got sick of seeing all of the other absolute garbage "executors" out there that are either loaded with viruses or require you to visit like 3 / 4 different ad sites to use them.

Why should we have to pay to get a decent cheat? Magma is completely free to use (and open sourced)! If you see something broken or something that you feel should be improved feel free to open up my code and give it some tinkering, that's the whole point after all! 

> ****Also feel free to recycle UI components, again I have no current plans to complete this project.*

## FAQ  

#### Where can I find more DLLs?

> The most reputable source to look for more DLLs is [UnknownCheats](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/search.php?searchid=18371288)

#### Where can I find more Scripts?

> The most reputable source to look for more Scripts is [V3rMillion](https://v3rmillion.net/)

#### Magma wont open when I run it!

 > You most likely left your antivirus enabled, or forgot to configure it to ignore Magma. If you don't have a third-party antivirus installed, read the section below on how to disable Windows Virus and Threat Protection. 

#### Why does Magma need Administrator Permissions?
 > Since magma has an on-board internal DLL injector, it needs to reference System files in order to work (`kernel32.dll` respectively). Without requiring admin permissions the DLL injector would simply break

#### Why does Magma flag as a virus?

> Due to the nature of Roblox exploits and the way they work (game manipulation, raw code injection, etc.) you need to disable Windows Security if on Windows 10 Home or Pro, and Windows Defender if on Windows 10 Enterprise and above, and if you have another antivirus software installed configure it to allow all files within the Magma directory ( Default: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Magma\` ). Magma is not a virus, and will not work with an unconfigured antivirus enabled, since it will automatically remove important files required for the application to launch. You can learn how to turn off Windows Defender [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJb9CuVAHMI). Magma uses a process called code injection to attach itself to a game. This process is also being used by some malicious software, which is why your antivirus tool may detects this download as malicious.

Magma is 100% safe to use, as long as you got it from here!

## Please Note
I had no part in making any of the injection APIs or Lua Scripts included in this application, and each one belongs to it's rightful owners.

#### USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
I am in no way responsible if you recieve any kind of in-game punishment for using this software, and as such by downloading Magma you agree to take full responsibility!

Happy Cheating!
